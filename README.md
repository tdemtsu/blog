Hello, this is Thomas Demtsu and Patrick Eveloucha project as stated in footer.tsx
This fulfills all the requirements of the project up to authentication.
That being said there are a couple of files that are a work in progress so they are not called in the index.tsx or app.tsx, we are currently facing troubles routing to a login page.

Also when outside sources (especially tailwindcss) were used we cited above unless it was a small and general usage.

Due to time constraint we werent able to finish authentication in the website and we were having issues with the type of Id and imageurl.
